# BMap

The following code is designed to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) using a Genetic Algorithm and to visualize the cities on a map using Leaflet.

This code is based on the implementations of the Genetic Algorithm provided by the Project Spot, which can be found at the following link: [Genetic Algorithm Tutorial](https://www.theprojectspot.com/tutorial-post/applying-a-genetic-algorithm-to-the-travelling-salesman-problem/5).

Additionally, it utilizes the Haversine formula to calculate distances, following the code example by Parzibyte, available at: [Haversine Formula in JavaScript](https://parzibyte.me/blog/2022/09/07/javascript-distancia-entre-2-coordenadas/).
